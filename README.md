# Text Mining: Sentiment and Authenticity Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and analysis for a comprehensive comparison of the performance of Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes (MNB) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning algorithms. The comparison is conducted for two tasks: sentiment analysis and authenticity classification. Various vectorization techniques, including TF-IDF, count vectorizer, and binary/bigram vectorizer, are employed to evaluate the models' performance.
